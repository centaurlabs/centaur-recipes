# DICOM to Image Conversion

This notebook demonstrates how to convert a Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) file to one or more images in PNG or JPEG format (depends if the DICOM is multi-frame or not). The output images are saved in a folder of your choosing.

Supports the following photometric interpretations:

- MONOCHROME1
- MONOCHROME2
- RGB
- YBR_FULL
- YBR_FULL_422

The "PALETTE COLOR" type is not supported because it is more complicated to process and out of the scope of this example notebook.

### Installation
No special installation is required, simply follow the notebook for step-by-step instructions.
