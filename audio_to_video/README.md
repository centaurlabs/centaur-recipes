## Summary
The code snippet in the notebook can be used to create a video using the supplied audio file. A still background image may be optionally provided. You may combine this recipe with the [audio_to_mel_spectrogram](../audio_to_mel_spectrogram) recipe to create a video with the audio over an image of the audio's mel spectrogram. Most audio, video, and image file formats are supported.

### Installation
No special installation steps required. Follow the virtual environment setup on
[the main repository page](../README.md#installation) and then follow the steps in the notebook.
