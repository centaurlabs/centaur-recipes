# DicomSeg Generation

## Summary
The code snippet in the notebook can be used to convert a WKT representation of
the geometries to a dicomseg file. Note that the script expects the WKT 
to be formatted with absolute coordinates. Additionally, any invalid geometries 
should be fixed or removed. 
You may use the recipes for [coordinate conversion](../coordinate_converter) and 
fixing invalid geometries for these steps.

### Installation
No special installation steps required. Follow the virtual environment setup on
[the main repository page](../README.md#installation) and then follow the steps in the notebook.
