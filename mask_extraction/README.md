# Mask Extraction

![Mask Extraction and Overlay](example/output/example_mask_overlay.png?raw=false "Mask Extraction and Overlay")

## Summary
The code snippet in the notebook can be used to extract a WKT representation of
the geometries from the mask image. Note that after the WKT has been extracted
it should be converted to centaur coordinates and any invalid geometries should
be fixed or removed. You may use the recipe (@TODO) for this step.

### Installation
No special installtion steps required. Follow the virtual environment setup on
the main repository page and then follow the steps in the notebook.
