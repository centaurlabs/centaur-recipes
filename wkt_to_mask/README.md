# Mask Generation

![Mask Extraction and Overlay](example/output/example_mask_overlay.png?raw=false "Mask Extraction and Overlay")

## Summary
The code snippet in the notebook can be used to convert a WKT representation of
the geometries to a grayscale mask image. Note that the script expects the WKT 
to be formatted with absolute coordinates. Additionally, any invalid geometries 
should be fixed or removed. 
You may use the recipes for [coordinate conversion](../coordinate_converter) and 
fixing invalid geometries (@TODO:link recipe) for these steps.

### Installation
No special installation steps required. Follow the virtual environment setup on
[the main repository page](../README.md#installation) and then follow the steps in the notebook.
