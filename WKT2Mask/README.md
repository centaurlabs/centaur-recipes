# Mask Extraction

![Mask Extraction and Overlay](example/output/example_mask_overlay.png?raw=false "Mask Extraction and Overlay")

## Summary
The code snippet in the notebook can be used to convert a WKT representation of
the geometries to a grayscale mask image. Note that before the WKT is inserted
it should be converted from centaur coordinates to absolute coordinates and any 
invalid geometries should be fixed or removed. 
You may use the recipe (@TODO) for this step.

### Installation
No special installation steps required. Follow the virtual environment setup on
the main repository page and then follow the steps in the notebook.
