# Circle Geometry Center Finder

## Summary
This recipe provides an easy-to-follow approach for computing the center of CIRCULARSTRING geometries. 
If you have a list of CIRCULARSTRING representations of circular arcs, 
this recipe will help you extract and compute the center point for each geometry.

### Example Input
`CIRCULARSTRING (48.3160321 40.0467466, 50.1013345 40.0467466, 48.3160321 40.0467466)`
- First Point (Start): (48.3160321, 40.0467466)
- Second Point (Middle): (50.1013345, 40.0467466)
- Third Point (Closing): (48.3160321, 40.0467466) (must be the same as the first)

### Installation
No special installation steps required. Follow the virtual environment setup on
[the main repository page](../README.md#installation) and then follow the steps in the notebook.
